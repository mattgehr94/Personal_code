# Hello, I'm Matt Gehr!

🎓 I'm on the verge of completing my Ph.D. in Psychology, with a specialization in statistical programming and data analysis. My academic journey has equipped me with a profound understanding of human behavior, which I've paired with my passion for coding to dive deep into the world of data science.

💼 As a Sr. Data Scientist at Lumen, I have honed my skills in predictive modeling and data analysis, leveraging SQL, R, and Python to unlock actionable insights from vast datasets. My contributions have ranged from developing intricate customer segmentation models to creating sophisticated churn prediction algorithms with over 97% accuracy.

🔍 My expertise lies in the practical application of statistical methods like t-tests, regressions, chi-square tests, and advanced machine learning techniques, all aimed at solving real-world business problems. My role has often bridged the gap between complex data and strategic decision-making, transforming raw numbers into compelling narratives that drive organizational growth.

🌐 On GitHub, I'm focused on showcasing projects that reflect my analytical acumen and my ability to translate data into meaningful stories. Here, you'll find repositories that demonstrate my proficiency in:

- Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics
- Time Series Analysis and Program Evaluation
- Conjoint and MaxDiff Analysis for Customer Preference
- Bayesian Statistics for Enhanced Decision-Making
- Survey Design and Data Collection Automation

🤝 I'm always on the lookout for collaborative opportunities where I can bring my quantitative research and coding skills to the table. Whether it's contributing to open-source projects or engaging in new partnerships, my goal is to drive innovation through data.

📫 If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, please feel free to reach out through GitHub or connect with me on [LinkedIn](your-linkedin-profile-link).

Thank you for stopping by my corner of GitHub, where data meets decision-making!
